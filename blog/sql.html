          <h2>Story about SQL</h2>

          When we finaly were done with C# it was time for SQL and databases. We
          hade to learn how to make one, how to use it, how to filter
          information. It was fun, and we have for sure different background
          that made this part really versitile. Some of us was more about the
          looks and the structure, others were more about how the functions is.
